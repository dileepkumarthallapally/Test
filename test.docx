Centralized API Gateway Ownership Model for AWS Cloud
Executive Summary
As the organization migrates from WSO2 Gateway (on-prem) to AWS API Gateway (cloud), it is critical that the Enterprise Integration Platform (EIP) team maintains centralized ownership of API Gateway infrastructure.

While API Gateway instances will exist in each AWS account for isolation and scalability, configuration and governance must remain centrally controlled.

API Gateway is part of the enterprise security and traffic control plane—not an application component.
Control Plane vs Data Plane
Control Plane (Platform Team Owned)
AWS API Gateway, Lambda Authorizer, IAM policies, JWT validation, throttling policies, routing enforcement, WAF integration, and Terraform modules.
Data Plane (Application Team Owned)
Lambda functions, Step Functions workflows, DynamoDB / RDS / S3, business logic, and OpenAPI contract definition.
Security Risk: Authentication Misconfiguration Example
Application team mistake:
resource "aws_apigatewayv2_route" "insecure_route" {
  api_id    = aws_apigatewayv2_api.api.id
  route_key = "GET /customer"
  authorization_type = "NONE"
}
Correct platform-controlled implementation:
resource "aws_apigatewayv2_route" "secure_route" {
  api_id    = aws_apigatewayv2_api.api.id
  route_key = "GET /customer"
  authorization_type = "CUSTOM"
  authorizer_id      = aws_apigatewayv2_authorizer.jwt_authorizer.id
}
JWT Validation Misconfiguration Risk
Application team mistake:
jwt_configuration {
 issuer   = "https://wrong-issuer.com"
 audience = ["any"]
}
Platform team enforcement:
jwt_configuration {
 issuer   = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0"
 audience = ["enterprise-api"]
}
Backend Exposure Risk
Application team mistake exposing Lambda publicly:
resource "aws_lambda_function_url" "dangerous" {
 function_name = aws_lambda_function.backend.function_name
 authorization_type = "NONE"
}
Correct secure access via API Gateway only.
IAM Privilege Escalation Risk
Application team mistake:
Action = "*"
Resource = "*" 
Platform team least privilege enforcement:
Action = ["dynamodb:GetItem"]
Resource = aws_dynamodb_table.customer.arn
Platform-Owned Terraform Gateway Module
module "api_gateway" {
 source = "git::ssh://git.enterprise/api-platform-modules/apigateway"
 api_name         = var.api_name
 jwt_issuer       = var.jwt_issuer
 jwt_audience     = var.jwt_audience
 enable_waf       = true
 enable_logging   = true
 enable_throttle  = true
}
Cross-Account Secure Deployment Role
resource "aws_iam_role" "api_platform_deploy_role" {
 assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
  Statement = [{
   Effect = "Allow"
   Principal = {
    Federated = "arn:aws:iam::<account>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
   }
   Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
  }]
 })
}
Compliance Requirements
Centralized ownership ensures compliance with SOC2, PCI DSS, SOX, and FFIEC requirements.
Ownership Model Recommendation
Platform Team Owns:
API Gateway, Lambda Authorizer, IAM policies, Terraform modules, authentication enforcement, routing policies, deployment pipeline.
Application Teams Own:
Business Lambda, Step Functions, database, and OpenAPI contract.
Final Recommendation
The Enterprise Integration Platform team must maintain centralized ownership of AWS API Gateway to ensure security, compliance, operational stability, and enterprise scalability.
